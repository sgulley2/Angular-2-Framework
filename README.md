# Angular-2-Framework

This is a framework I created during my assignment at Medical Mutual.  It is a full framework based on Angular-CLI that allows any developer 
to create apps, component, pipes, directives, etc and even includes a full app that contains examples of all the major features of 
Angular 2 including, forms, routing, validations, services, etc.  There is an readme which explains fully how to use it
